# Evaluating-Passes

This project is about comparing passing across Europe's Top Leagues and International tournaments.

In this project, I visualize the passing rates in the final third for the Premier League, La Liga, World Cup 2018, Serie A, and Bundesliga. I also use statistics to build a regression model for a metric I call xSuccessPass. Its purpose is to accept the position at which a pass is made and predict the probability it reaches a teammate. This model can then be used to reveal players who can successfully make passes in their opponent's half.

This project is currently in progress and should be completed by Oct. 20th.
