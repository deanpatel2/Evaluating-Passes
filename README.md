# Which Country Produces the Best Passers?

This project is about comparing passing across Europe's Top Leagues and International tournaments.

In this project, I visualize the passing rates in the final third for the Premier League, La Liga, World Cup 2018, Serie A, and Bundesliga. I also use statistics to build a regression model for a metric I call xSuccessPass. The metric's purpose is to accept the position at which a pass is made and predict the probability it reaches a teammate. This model can then be used to reveal players with better passing ability and can be used to compare across nations.

This project is currently in progress. The code is an adaption of David Sumpter's xG model code [here](https://github.com/Friends-of-Tracking-Data-FoTD/SoccermaticsForPython).
